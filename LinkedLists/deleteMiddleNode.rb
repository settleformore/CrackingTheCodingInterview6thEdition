# Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle (i.e, any nodes but the first and last node, not necessarily the exact middle) of a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

# Example
# Input: the node c from the linked list a->b->c->d->e->f
# Result: nothing is return, but the new linked list looks like a->b->d->e->f
